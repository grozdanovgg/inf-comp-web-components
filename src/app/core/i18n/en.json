  "warehouse.modal.information.nftContent": "Infinite Fleet is designed to give you the full custody of your assets, and in this case: your ships. To provide this powerfull feature, we use NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens), which are cryptographic assets provided by Liquid Network. Every NFT is unique and associated forever to a single ship. Owning this NFT is the proof that the ship is yours. By clicking on the \"View NFT\" button, you can see that the NFT encloses informations about its underlying ship. For example its model, its serial number and how much were issued. ",
  "warehouse.modal.information.withdrawalDepositsHeading": "Withdrawals And Deposits",
  "warehouse.modal.information.withdrawalDepositsContentPara1": "When the ships are in the game, or when you just bought it, their NFT is stored securely in our custodial wallet. At any time, you can request to withdraw your NFT to your own wallet. We will record your request and execute is as soon as possible. Once it is approved , the NFT will be transferred to your wallet, meaning we won't have control over it any more. Only ships whose NFT is in our custody are playable, so after a NFT withdrawal, the ship will not be visible in the game.",
  "warehouse.modal.information.withdrawalDepositsContentPara2": "Once the NFT is in your wallet, you can do whatever you want with it, it is now your responsability and yours only. If you lose access to the wallet or send it to the wrong address, we won't be able to restore your NFT : the ship will be unusable in the game forever.",
  "warehouse.modal.information.withdrawalDepositsContentPara3": "If you want to play with the ship again, you have to deposit its NFT. Deposits are processed instantly if you stay on the deposit page until you get a confirmation. You can also make some deposits without letting us know, just by sending a NFT to your deposit address, but it will be processed later. For a better privacy, you can request a new deposit address whenever you want. Once the NFT deposit is confirmed, the ship is attached to your account and you can play it in the game.",
  "warehouse.modal.information.benefitsHeading": "What are the Benefits?",
  "warehouse.modal.information.benefitsContentPara1": "By distributing the ship's NFTs, we give you an insight of what will be feasible in the future. For the moment, the interactions are limited, but one good use case is exchanging ships between players.",
  "warehouse.modal.information.benefitsContentPara2": "Soon, we will release a marketplace where players can trade assets peer to peer.",
